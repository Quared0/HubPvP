# HubPvP

HubPvP plugin, created by Quared.

# What is HubPvP?

HubPvP is an essential plugin for every server's lobby. This allows players to equip the sword and PvP each other! Every
message and option can be changed in the plugin's config.yml.

# How it works

When someone equips the sword, their PvP is enabled. This allows them to PvP other players with their PvP on as well.
Once the sword is unequipped, the player will no longer be in PvP and can't be attacked.

# Features:

- Fully customizable
- Configuration reloading
- Easy to set up
- Fun plugin for everyone

# Commands:

- /hubpvp - Permission: hubpvp.reload

# What versions is it?

HubPvP natively supports 1.19. You may attempt to use it on earlier versions, however, support will not be given for them.

# Where can I download it?
